            <h4 class='subtitle'>What is an Ultimate Ironman?</h4>
            <p>
              <span>An</span> ultimate ironman is just like a regular iron account in oldschool runescape, but they're not allowed to use the bank, create items sets at the Grand Exchange, use their miscellania kingdom for resources, use the seed vault at the farming guild, get daily buckets of sand from bert, or send their servant to the bank OR the sawmill. <br/><span>On</span> top of that, they also don't keep 3 items when they die, no matter how or where they die, and they're not allowed to use the protect item prayer to keep their most expensive item on death.
            </p>
            <h4 class='subtitle'>But... why?</h4>
            <p>
              <span>"That</span> sound ridiculous why would you do that to yourself?"<br/><br/>
              <span>Personally,</span> it feels like I'm playing a completely different game. Most things you do have to be approached from a new angle, thought about differently. Item and inventory management becomes new again, having to pick and choose what to keep, what to drop, what to alch, or drop to your mule to help pay for bonds. <br/><br/>
              <span>For</span> someone who's played runescape, and now oldschool, for entirely too much of their life, playing as an ultimate breaths new life into the game they love.

            <h4 class='subtitle d-flex flex-column align-items-end'>Death</h4>
            <p>
              <span>If</span> you want to play a UIM you're going to die. A lot. Any activity that requires you to not have items on you, like rogues den, going to entrana, doing anything in the wilderness, you're going to have to kill yourself. <br/><br/> <span><i>And</span> for once, that's not just an edgy meme.</i> <br/>
            </p>
            <h4 class='subtitle d-flex flex-column align-items-end'>Death Mechanics</h4>
            <p>
              <span>Unlike</span> regular accounts, and normal/hardcore iron accounts, ultimates don't have gravestones. When you die, everything you have on your person, including untradeables, is dropped in a pile where you stand, and stays there for an hour. Without keeping 3 items, and being unable to use protect item, you have to figure out how to get back to your stuff, and get it organized in your inventory and/or looting bag, before it disappears. <br/><br/>
            </p>
            <h4 class='subtitle d-flex flex-column align-items-end'>Death Storage</h4>
            <br>
              <span>As </span>an ultimate, there aren't many places you can store most things, which leaves you with a very limited amount of space to work with. Because of this, most ultimates choose to take advantage of the normal death mechanics, as well as boss death mechanics, as a sort of pseudo-bank.<br/><br/> <span>In</span> the early game, all you really have access to is the one hour death pile. It's stressful, it's timed, but it works. Pick the nettles by the draynor village jail until you run out of HP, set a timer for an hour, and go about your business. The main purpose of this, in the early game, is to do quests that need no items, like recruitment drive, fremennik trials, or anything that involves going to entrana. <br/></br> <span>As</span> you get further in the game, though, you gain access to what's known as 'death banks'. These are gained when you unlock bosses like zulrah, hespori, or vorkath, and aren't subject to the one hour death pile timer. When you die to one of these bosses, your items are put into an interface, usually unlocked by paying someone close to the entrance of the boss. Usually the first death bank you unlock is Zulrah, which is free, but doesn't allow you to choose which items you withdraw, but rather gives you back items in the order you have them in your inventory, but the others, like hespori, vorkath, grotesque guardians, etc. cost a relatively small fee to unlock, but allow you to pick and choose which items to withdraw. <br/><br/> <span><b>With</span> <i>ANY</i> death storage mechanics, if you die with items stored, you will lose all of them.</b>

            <h4 class='subtitle'>Starting Out</h4>
            <p>
              <span>Early</span> game for an ultimate is very similar to the other iron modes: 
                <ul><li>Do agility for graceful.</li><li>Get 99 firemaking while you're 10hp</li><li>Do 99 thieving for cash.</li><li>Etc etc etc.</li></ul> <span>That</span> is if you can stand doing all that stuff. It's a videogame after all, do whatever you want. You used to have to do quite a few quests that require empty inventories before training too much, or gaining too many items, but untradeables go to your death pile/death storage on death now, so it's not as important.<br/> <span>Though</span> it is annoying juggling death piles, so you still may want to do that. The only real difference, in my opinion, with how death mechanics and untradeables work, is how quickly you might push towards things like death storage bosses, or how quickly you start training construction for costume room storage.
            </p>
            <h4 class='subtitle'>Questing</h4>
            <p>
              <span>If</span> you're taking the path of doing quests that require empty inventories or going to entrana first, here's a list of some of the important ones: <ul><li>Recruitment Drive</li><li>Waterfall Quest</li><li>Lost City</li><li>Enlightened Journey</li></ul><span>There</span> are more, but they have higher requirements, like heroes quest, or aren't entirely important to unlock before you have easier, non-timed death storage.<br/><span>Other</span> that those, you can really quest how you want to. Push towards death storage methods, unlock lunars for doing ZMI runecrafting, you can really do questing as you would for all other official game modes. They just take quite a lot longer...<br/><br/> <span>When</span> you start a quest, unlike in other game modes, I find it best to ignore the required item list at the beggining of the guide, unless it's quite short, and would fit in your inventory with multiple free spaces. Instead, look at the required items at the beginning of each section of the guide (or read through each section if it's not updated to have a list per section), that way you don't spend time collecting items only to have to drop them due to needing inventory space to hold quest items. You'll save a lot of time that way.
